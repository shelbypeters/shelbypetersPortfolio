The duo gained wealth and fame a year later for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. this was followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user interface). After being ousted of Apple in 1985, he went on to oversee the creation of the two new companies: NeXT computer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar.</a> With the success of the movie Toy Story, Steve became a billionaire.
