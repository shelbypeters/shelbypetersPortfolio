      <h1>About Jon Arbuckle</h1>
    <img src="images/jon-arbuckle.png" alt="jon-arbuckle"/>
    <p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years olds and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am the proud owner of a cat names <strong>Garfield</strong> a dog named <strong>Odie</strong>. Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to cat, while Odie is a dog without a brain. Although my pets drive me crazy, I can't imagine life without them. 
    <br/><br/> 
    I spend about hald my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all of Garfield's favorite foods, or else he'll get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marinara sauce, frozen pizza, and <strong>lots and lots</strong> of lasagna. When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything in grocery bag before I even have time to put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate everything that I bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food. <em>I wasn't happy about that.</em> </p>
