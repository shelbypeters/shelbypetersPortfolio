Consuming an API
  1) Third party tells us what endpoints/routes
  2) What type of response - json or xml or something else
      3) Do we need authentication or authorization
  4) How much data - everything or or specifics
      5) How many requests can I make????
  6) What data we can actually get - name, birthday, or everything!!!

Building an API
  1) We get to decide what the endpoints/routes are and methods
  2) We decide on what type of data - json or xml or primitives
  3) We decide how much data the client gets back
  4) We decide what data is actually returned - we are going to send SS#!!!!?
  5) We decide the status code to send

CRUD - what is it?
  Create - adding a todo to our list
    - POST method
  Read - get todos and display it
    - GET method
  Update - have we completed the todo - mark it with a line
    - PUT method
  Delete - remove the todo from our list
    - DELETE method
