        <p className="name">Shelby Peters</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in the Chicago suburbs. In 2016, I moved to Austin, TX to escape the snow and find new adventures. For 6 years, I worked with a small real estate brokerage and enjoyed the booming Austin housing market. In 2021, I decided it was time for a new challenge: Finding a career that was also a passion. I have since graduated from a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp and enjoy learning new methods and solutions to coding problems every day. My portfolio grows a little more each day, and I am anxious for the opportunity to bring my skills and creativity to a new team.</p>
